## General API Information
* The base endpoint is: **https://indodax.com/tapi**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **descending** order. newest first, oldest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.

## Error Codes
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR

Sample Payload below:
```javascript
{
    "success": 0,
    "error": "Invalid credentials. API not found or session has expired.",
    "error_code": "invalid_credentials"
}
```

## General Information on Endpoints
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* All requests must be sent with POST.
* For each request you need to include these variable to make the call valid: method and nonce or timestamp.

    | Parameter | Description | Optional | Example |
    |-|-|-|-|
    |`method`| Specify the method you want to call | no | getInfo|
    |`nonce`| An increment integer. For example if the last request's nonce is 1000, the next request should be 1001 or a larger number. To learn more about [nonce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce)  | no | 1000

    | Parameter | Description | Optional | Example |
    |-|-|-| - |
    |`method`| Specify the method you want to call | no | getInfo
    |`timestamp`| This parameter should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent | no | 1578303960000
    |`recvWindow`| The value should specify the number of millisecond after timestamp where your request is valid. That mean your request still valid if it sent and processed within timestamp and timestamp + recvWindow. Default value is 5000 (milliseconds) | no | 1578303937000
    
## Endpoint Security Type
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `Key`
  header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* There are 3 different permissions that can be applied to API Key: view, trade and withdraw

    |Permission | Allowed Methods|
    |-|-|
    |view | getInfo, transHistory, tradeHistory, openOrders, orderHistory, getOrder |
    |trade | trade, cancelOrder |
    |withdraw | withdrawFeee, withdrawCoin |
    
## Signed (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint Security
* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `Sign`, to be
  sent in the  `header`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA512` signatures.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`. example `*(?param=val&param1=val1) encrypted with method HMAC-SHA512 using secret key*`
  
### Timing Security
* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.
* The logic is as follows:
  ```php
  if ($timestamp >= ($serverTime + 1000) || ($serverTime - $timestamp) > $recvWindow) {
      // reject request
  } else {
      // process request
  }
  ```
**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable, which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.

### SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST getInfo
Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a vaild signed payload from the
Linux command line using. `curl`

| Key | Value
|-|-
| `apiKey` | AEDHIGAT-QATEGWOX-OPCSCPQX-2E00B1L7-VJBXXKMA
| `secretKey` | f60617a68fcce028f0a90bc9eb765d17379eb548cc935c01a7ee3186eecf870e9b68f27a31bcfe8d

| Parameter | Value |
|-|-|
|`method`| getInfo |
|`timestamp`| 1578304294000 |
|`recvWindow`| 1578303937000 |

#### Example : send parameter using request body
* **requestBody:** method=getInfo&timestamp=1578304294000&recvWindow=1578303937000
* **HMAC SHA512 signature:**
    ```
    [linux]$ echo -n "method=getInfo&timestamp=1578304294000&recvWindow=1578303937000" | openssl dgst -sha512 -hmac "f60617a68fcce028f0a90bc9eb765d17379eb548cc935c01a7ee3186eecf870e9b68f27a31bcfe8d"

#### Trade Endpoints
This method is for opening a new order

> ℹ️ **Important Updates**
> 
> As per 10 September 2022,
> - You may experience under filled order if using `idr` parameter when create buy order. To solve this issue, simply send `btc` instead `idr` and use `order_type : "limit"`.
> - You can create buy limit order using coin (eg: `btc`) as amount.
> - You can use `order_type : "market"` to create market order.
> - You can try the new API version by creating account in https://demo-indodax.com. You will receive balance for some coins, approximately 1 minute after successfully sign-up.
> - These coins can be used for trade testing, but can't be withdrawn. You also can't deposit any coin to demo-indodax.com.
>
> ℹ️ **Information**
> 
> We also have a rate limit feature in place for the trade api. If you call the trade api for the same `pair` for more than 10 times in a second you would get the following error and would not be able to trade that `pair` for the next 5 seconds
> ```json
> status code: 429
> content type: application/json
> body: { "message": "Your User ID sent too many trade request for pair BTCIDR, please try again in 5 seconds" }
